### :heavy_exclamation_mark:	As of November 15th, 2022, Capybara has achieved beta status :heavy_exclamation_mark:	

### About Capybara

Capybara is a dynamically typed, semi-whitespace sensitive programming language, taking the best parts from Lua, Rust, and Python to create a readable, comprehensive and simple programming language.

### Why Capybara?

Capybara's main focus is to provide a compromise between high level and low level programming languages: while high level languages like Python have wonderful readability and power, they lack critical components that low level programmers love using, such as:

* Memory management / Pointers
* Portability
* Speed

At the same time, low level languages don't provide the myriad of comforts that high level languages like Python provide, such as:

* Readable syntax
* Dynamic typing
* Flexibility

Capybara is meant to provide the best of both worlds, allowing both high level and low level programmers to transfer seamlessly between the two. To accomplish this, Capybara provides:

* Readability
* Power and Speed
* Dynamic typing
* Portability
* Memory Management
* Compatibility with new technology
* and a lot more!

### Where do I get Capybara?

:warning: Capybara is currently too early in its development for it to be viable in a production setting. Capybara should only be meant for hobbyist use until it has been decreed stable enough to warrant otherwise. :warning:

Currently, Capybara can't be built using cmake. Cloning this repository is a viable way to experiment with the early version of Capybara.

### How do I contribute?

We need testers! Please make an Issue if you come across an error or a PR if you know how to fix it. Capybara is still in early development.
